I am a first year computer science major at CSUF. I am planning to graduate in the year 2027 hopefully.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

    * Lab 6 Part 2
    In this lab we got to create a program that would play blackjack. I really enjoyed this because blackjack is one of my favorite card games and being able to create it using code is very cool and fun. In this lab I learned how having multiple extra functions really makes it more easier when calling functions and determining the value of the card. I also got to learn how to include bools into "if" statements which was very useful and fun to learn.

    * Lab 8 part 1
    In this lab we did a command line mad lib which was very interesting and very fun to program. I enjoyed this because I liked the concept of using code to repeat a sandwich order and I though it was funny. I also enjoyed this because I learned a lot about Input Validation and how to make a requirement of a certain amount of arguments. I was cool to see how if you didn't have 4 arguments you can make an error message appear saying that you need more arguments.

    * Lab 4 part 1
    This lab was about unit conversions. I really enjoyed this one mainly because of how practical it is. I thought this was very useful in everyday lives and can be applied in the real world. It was also very enjoyable to code as well. In this code I was utilizing cout and cin to get responses from users and was using double. I don't think we had used it before so it was nice to learn how it works. This was also enjoyable to code because It was challenging to write all the functions for the conversions but when I finally got it, it was very satisfying.
